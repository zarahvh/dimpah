For instance, you will learn various strategies of dealing with missing entries either by removing them completely or by trying to replicate its values. The kind of social data we are dealing with is vast and unorganized, which makes organizing it for analysis no easy task. In reality, you will spend most of your time on working through such data challenges. \n",

We will look at the basics of clustering that delivers you powerful results very fast. In particular, we will use the k-means algorithm, which was invented by MacQueen in the late 1960s (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering). Despite being ancient in terms of computer lives, k-means is still widely used as it delivers good results with great performance. Performance in computing describes the effort we need in terms of computational resources. You will generally notice performance by the execution time. \n",

The article describes that, while clustering (and other machine learning algorithms) can produce very persuasive results, these do not come for free. They are no free lunch. The results always depend on the assumptions we put in such as the number of clusters in k-means but also how we describe the vote in Congress, how we measure somebody’s influence, etc. This is the famous 'No Free Lunch Theorem' in Machine Learning.
